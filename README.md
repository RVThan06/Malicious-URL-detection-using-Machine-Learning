## Malicious URL detection with Machine Learning 

#### This project consist of 651191 URLs which fall into four classes (benign, defacement, phising, malware). The goal of this project is to classify theb URLs into 4 classes. Thus machine learning models are used to solve this problem. 

### Steps taken in this project

1. Data is extracted and analysed
2. Feature engineering is done to extract 25 features from the URLs
3. The features are scaled
4. Training and test data set is split by stratified sampling
5. Five base machine learning models are trained
6. Two ensemble models are built which are stacking and voting classifier

### In conclusion, the ensemble model built using the base models, performed better than the best individual classifier by achieving a 0.5% higher accuracy.
